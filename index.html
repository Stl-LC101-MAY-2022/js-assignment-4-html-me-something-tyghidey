        Once you learn to ride a bicycle, you never forget.
      </h1>
      <p>
        In my never-ending quest of self-improvement, I decided to tackle a fear:
        ride a bike for the first time in 20 years. The easiest (and did I mention
        cheapest) way to travel around the small Caribbean town was with a
        bicycle. Don’t let the impromptu photo in front of the rental shop fool
        you, the roads were full of pedestrians, motorcycles, cars, and other
        bicycles. This was by no means a joy ride. However, by the end of the day
        I could say that riding a bicycle was as easy as I remembered. I can
        confidentially tell you it’s true: “once you learn to ride a bicycle, you
        never forget”.

        When in Costa Rica, eat Red Snapper. Order it grilled or have it fried,
        but whatever you do just make sure to order this fish. Preferably keep the
        head the plate for the whole effect. It complements the patacones and the
        beans and rice. Restaurants in Manuel Antonio are known for their
        beautiful cliff views since this town is where the mountains meet the
        ocean. I felt like a fish out of water when I looked down at the trees. I
        wouldn’t recommend sitting to close to the edge if you have a fear of
        heights…. Or Iguanas. They are notorious for climbing up and biting
        guests. Pura Vida.

        Did you know you can search Instagram for popular spots to visit? I sure
        didn’t until I discovered this abandoned hotel full of graffiti (and gram
        worthy content) through a simple hashtag search. I invited my baby sister
        to visit for her 21st birthday. I essentially spent that afternoon taking
        pictures of my sister who had aspirations to be an influencer and birthday
        content is very popular. A year has passed since her photoshoot and she
        has done nothing with the pictures. Apparently nursing school was her true
        passion. At least I have one photo to show I was there.
